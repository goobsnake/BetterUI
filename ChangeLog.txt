2.71 Changes:

[INDENT]1. Implemented: Added new "quick destroy" feature to the Enhanced Inventory settings - New setting is disabled by default, but when enabled it'll allow you to delete any item without confirmation. 
* Use caution when this setting is enabled!

2. Changed: To circumvent the new insecure dialog errors when destroying items, I've made all items be required to be marked as junk before they can be destroyed.
* You can always enable the new quick destroy feature if this change becomes an annoyance but be cautioned the new quick destroy feature will not give a confirmation prompt, so accidental destroys "could" happen.[/INDENT]


2.70 Changes:

[INDENT]1. Implemented: Added "Link to Chat" back as the default "X" button for any inventory item not associated with "Equip", "Use", "Assign", etc.
2. Changed: When Enhanced Inventory is enabled, retrieving items from the Craftbag will now retrieve the full stack count up to the max inventory stack count (200).

6. Changed: When Enhanced Inventory is enabled, the Quickslot assignments are now done within the inventory screen. 
*The add-on will now search for any free Quickslot assignment slots and assign it to that slot first. If no slots are free and you hit the assign button, it will assign the item to the top Quickslot slot, overwriting whatever was there. If you hit the assign button on any Quickslot item that is currently assigned, it will remove that Quickslot assignment. If you have any collectibles assigned to the Quickslots, you will have to remove or change them via the collections area.

[INDENT]1. Fixed: Lib files will now be referenced correctly to the ones bundled with BetterUI, preventing load up LUA errors - Issue was occurring if the user had no other addons installed that were bundled with the libs BetterUI needs (Somewhat rare since most addons share these common libs)[/INDENT]

2.63 Changes:

[INDENT]1. Revamped: The add-on settings screen has gone through a significant revamp to make the settings easier to find and toggle on/off. I felt the add-on settings area was too busy and made features difficult to find or understand. 
2. Removed: Broken or redundant features/settings along with a fair amount of unused code have been removed. If I've removed a setting/feature that you feel is a must have, I'll explore adding it back in.
3. Fixed: Removing the last item in an inventory category will no longer display an error and cause the add-on UI glitch out to the point where a /reloadui or logout was required. 
*Thanks Tyrobius for pointing out with steps to replicate!
4. Fixed: "Bank is full" or "Inventory is full" messages will no longer occur if the item being moved can stack with an existing item inside the full bank or bag. (Fix isn't perfect but works) 
*Thanks OP88 for pointing it out.
5. Fixed: Item stack count graphic will no longer get stuck if exiting the bank or inventory screens using a hotkey other then the "B" button. This could sometimes cause weird behavior when returning those UI screens or with character movements.[/INDENT]
